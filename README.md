### Hi there 👋


I'm Emmanuel and it is nice to have you stop by. ✨🙏
I'm a Full-stack developer, computer technician, and network engineer.
I have a strong passion for learning because I believe in the saying that the moment one stops learning, he starts dying.
My journey in web development is dynamic, not static, as I keep improving my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Node.js, Next.js, PostgreSQL, and other programming languages and their frameworks. I have also delved into the world of AI (Artificial Intelligence) as technology is metamorphosing in a geometric progression.
