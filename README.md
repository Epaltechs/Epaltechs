### Hi there 👋


I'm Emmanuel and it is nice to have you stop by. ✨🙏
I'm a Full-stack developer, computer technician and network engineer.
I have a strong passion for learning because I believe in the saying that the moment one stop learning, he starts dying.
The journey of adding to what I know in web development is ongoing, as I keep improving on my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and other programming languages and their frameworks.
