### Hi there 👋


I'm Emmanuel and it is nice to have you stop by. ✨🙏
I'm a computer technician/network engineer and presently into the world of software development.
I have a strong passion for learning because I believe in the saying that the moment one stop learning, he starts dying.
The journey of adding to what I know in web development is ongoing, with JavaScript, React, Ruby on Rails, and other programming languages progressively adding up to my knowledge of HTML and CSS.
